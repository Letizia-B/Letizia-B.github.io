        <p>I am a PhD student of Astrophysics at the University of Bologna, where I am supervised by prof. Sirio Belli. My main research interest is investigating star-formation quenching in massive, quiescent galaxies both at high and low redshift. I am also curious about the relationship between the AGN and its host galaxy, and the interplay between different feedback mechanisms.</p>
        <p>I work mainly with spectroscopic data from JWST/NIRSpec. </p>
